\section{Questionnaire: Exploring Your Infinite Potential}
Instructions:

For each statement, rate your agreement on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is "Strongly
Disagree" and 5 is "Strongly Agree."
	\begin{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}
		\item Strongly Disagree
		\item Disagree
		\item Neutral
		\item Agree
		\item Strongly Agree
		\end{itemize}
    \item When facing a challenging task, I see it as an opportunity to learn and improve.
    		\begin{itemize}
		\item Strongly Disagree
		\item Disagree
		\item Neutral
		\item Agree
		\item Strongly Agree
		\end{itemize}
	\item I am willing to put in the effort to overcome obstacles and achieve my goals.
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Strongly Disagree
		\item Disagree
		\item Neutral
		\item Agree
		\item Strongly Agree
		\end{itemize}
	\item I view failures as valuable learning experiences rather than as signs of
	inadequacy.
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Strongly Disagree
		\item Disagree
		\item Neutral
		\item Agree
		\item Strongly Agree
		\end{itemize}
	\item I believe that with determination and hard work, I can continually improve my
	skills.
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Strongly Disagree

		\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
\section{Rubric for Interpretation:}	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 15-20 points: You have a strong belief in your infinite potential. You
		embrace challenges, view failures as opportunities, and are committed to 
		continuous growth.
		\item 10-14 points: You have a moderately positive belief in your infinite
		potential. You see room for growth but may need to work on embracing challenges
		and learning from setbacks.
		\item 5-9 points: Your belief in infinite potential is somewhat limited. Consider
		exploring strategies to shift your mindset towards growth and resilience.
		\item 1-4 points: You may have a fixed mindset, believing that your abilities are
		largely static. It's essential to work on developing a more growth-oriented
		perspective.
		\end{itemize}
		
Remember that this questionnaire provides a starting point for self-reflection, and it's
never too late to cultivate a stronger belief in your infinite potential. Embracing
challenges, learning from failures, and seeking continuous improvement can lead to
remarkable personal growth.
