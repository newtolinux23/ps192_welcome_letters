\subsection*{Bell Schedule}
\label{sec:org77a89b8}
Dear Parent or Guardian,

A bell schedule specifies the start time and duration of one or more instructional periods on each day of a day pattern. A consistent daily schedule and step-by-step routines give children a predictable day. A Bell Schedule helps children:
\begin{itemize}
\item Feel in control of their environment
\item Feel safe, secure, and comfortable
\item Know what is happening now and what comes next
\item Know how to do an activity or task
\item Engage in learning
\end{itemize}

Just like adults, children feel more confident and secure when their daily activities are predictable and familiar.

\subsection*{Uniform Policy}
\label{sec:orgcca2c0e}
Dear Parent or Guardian,

The uniform policy will be enforced during school hours and at all school-related events and activities, such as field trips and special assemblies.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Burgundy Shirt}: All students are required to wear a burgundy-colored shirt as the upper part of their uniform.
\item \textbf{Navy Pants}: Navy blue pants or trousers are to be worn as the lower part of the uniform.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{\textbf{Benefits of the Uniform Policy}}

Uniforms serve as a unifying element within our school community and offer several significant advantages:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Promoting Equality}: Uniforms eliminate socioeconomic disparities among students, ensuring that everyone is dressed the same way, regardless of their familyâ€™s financial circumstances.
\item \textbf{Enhancing Focus}: Wearing uniforms reduces distractions related to fashion and peer pressure, allowing students to concentrate on their studies and personal growth.
\item \textbf{Fostering School Pride}: A uniform instills a sense of pride and belonging among students, helping them identify with and appreciate their school community.
\item \textbf{Improving Safety}: Uniforms make it easier to identify intruders on school premises, enhancing overall security.
\item \textbf{Preparing for Future Success}: Encouraging a dress code similar to
professional attire helps prepare students for future careers where a
professional appearance is important.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{\textbf{Dress Down Days}}

We understand that personal expression is important, and therefore, "Dress Down
Days" will be occasionally scheduled throughout the school year, allowing
students to express their individuality through clothing choices. We kindly
request your cooperation and support in ensuring that your child arrives at
school dressed in accordance with our uniform policy. We believe that this will
contribute to a more positive and productive learning environment for all
students.

\pagebreak
\vspace*{-0.5cm}

\textbf{Contact Information}

Should you have any questions or concerns regarding the uniform policy, please feel free to reach out to our Parent Coordinator, Ms. Angela Rijo, via the following channels:

\subsection*{Promotional Criteria and Grading Policy}
\label{sec:org22babf9}
Dear Parent or Guardian,

Chancellor Regulation A-501 implements a system-wide promotion policy with
clearly defined standards for promotion for each grade. The P.S. 192 Promotional Criteria Policy provides the process and procedures
for the implementation of this promotion policy. This policy is effective as of September 5th, 2024.

This policy is being promulgated in the context of the following goals established by the Chancellorâ€™s
Regulation A-501:

All students in Kindergarten through grade 5 will meet or exceed rigorous academic standards in a performance-based core curriculum. In grades 3 through 5, all students will meet or exceed the promotion standards referred to in this regulation, and set forth in DOE issued guidance, in order to be promoted to the next grade and, ultimately, to be prepared for college and careers.

\begin{itemize}
\item The entire school community will be engaged continuously in creating and supporting effective strategies for improved student achievement.
\item A comprehensive student assessment system, aligned with established State and City performance standards, will be used on an ongoing basis to measure student progress and to improve classroom instruction.

\subsection*{Visitor and Safety Guidelines Procedures}
\label{sec:orgfbabc58}
Dear Parent or Guardian,

We are pleased to present the guidelines and procedures for our esteemed institution, Jacob H. Schiff/P.S. 192. These guidelines and procedures have been meticulously designed to prioritize the safety and security of all individualsâ€”our valued students, dedicated staff, and respected visitorsâ€”while fostering an environment that is welcoming and inclusive. We sincerely appreciate your cooperation in adhering to these essential protocols.
\begin{greenbox}[Visitor Registration]
\begin{itemize}
\item Upon Arrival: All visitors, including parents, guardians, volunteers, contractors, and esteemed guests, are kindly requested to enter the school premises through the main entrance and proceed to the safety agent desk for registration.
\item Warm Welcome: Our School Safety Agent or designated school staff will warmly welcome all visitors, inquire about the purpose of your visit, and request a valid photo ID.
\item Identification: To ensure security, visitors must present a valid form of identification, such as a driver's license, government-issued ID, foreign or US passport, or consulate identification card. Subsequently, visitors will be given an identification sticker, which must be prominently displayed throughout their visit. The School Safety Agent will assist in issuing the identification sticker.
\item Assistance Notification: Once the School Safety Agent or designated school staff completes the registration process, they will notify the parent coordinator by calling X1190. This will facilitate further assistance for the visitor, whether waiting in the lobby or the auditorium.
\item Departure Protocol: Visitors are kindly requested to sign out with the School Safety Agent or designated school staff upon leaving the building. The identification sticker should be returned; the main entrance is the recommended exit point.
\end{itemize}
\end{greenbox}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Language Assistance:}
\begin{itemize}
\item When a visitor does not communicate in English, our School Safety Agent (SSA) or designated school staff member will try to identify the visitor's language. A multi-language poster displayed at the safety desk will be used for language identification. Once the language is ascertained, the visitor will be directed to the parent coordinator for further assistance. In cases where we need staff proficient in the visitor's language on-site, the parent coordinator will engage the DOE's Over-the-Phone Interpretation Unit to arrange an on-demand interpreter.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Appointments:}
\begin{itemize}

\subsection*{Missing Student Protocol}
\label{sec:org0878644}
\textbf{Re: Implementation of the Missing Student Protocol, effective as of September 5th, 2024}

This Missing Student Protocol, Visitor and Safety Guidelines Procedures  is established to ensure the safety and well-being of all students at PS192. It outlines the steps to be taken immediately if a student is identified as missing, ensuring a swift and efficient response by all staff members. The protocol aligns with NYCDOE and UFT guidelines and is designed to provide clarity and consistency in handling such critical situations.

\textbf{Reporting a Missing Child}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textbf{Immediate Reporting}}: If a staff member identifies a missing child or notices a child who eludes adult supervision, they must immediately use their cell phone to text the administration and the parent coordinator while they are seeking or following the child.
\item \textbf{\textbf{Building Response Team (BRT) Activation}}: If the child is confirmed missing, the Principal will activate the Building Response Team (BRT) to assist in locating the student and preventing them from leaving the premises.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Search Efforts}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textbf{Comprehensive Search}}: The BRT and all available school staff will conduct a thorough search of both indoor and outdoor areas throughout the entire school premises.
\item \textbf{\textbf{Intercom Announcement}}: An announcement will be made via the school-wide intercom by the secretary, using the code phrase: "The lion is out of the den. Call me if you see him or find him." This alert notifies staff of the missing child and helps gather information on the student's last known location.
\item \textbf{\textbf{Law Enforcement Notification}}: If the child is not found within a specific timeframe, local law enforcement will be notified. The Principal and/or the BRT chairperson will be responsible for contacting 911 and informing the Borough Safety Director and the D6 Superintendent.
\item \textbf{\textbf{Student Information Profile}}: Upon the arrival of law enforcement, the Principal and/or BRT chairperson will provide them with a student information profile.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Communication, Documentation, and Feedback}
\newpage \vspace*{-1cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textbf{Parent/Guardian Notification}}: The administration will contact the parent or guardian to inform them of the situation.
\item \textbf{\textbf{Incident Documentation}}: Staff members responsible for the child's supervision must complete an OORS report form detailing the incident before leaving the premises if the incident occurred before 1 p.m. The form will be submitted to Assistant Principal, Dr. Milagros DueÃ±o.
\item \textbf{\textbf{Incident Review}}: The Principal will review the incident form with the UFT Chapter Leader and the BRT chairperson, gather feedback and suggestions, and may convene a meeting with the involved staff members for further review and discussion.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preventive Measures}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textbf{Hallway and Bathroom Monitoring}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Second Floor}: Ms. Del Orbe, Ms. Cuesta, Mr. Abreu, and Mr. Suero oversee the monitoring of the second-floor hallway and bathrooms.
\item \textbf{First Floor}: Ms. Clemons, Ms. Rijo, and the designee assigned by the principal of MS 209 supervise the first-floor hallway and bathroom facilities.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textbf{Exit Security}}: Ms. Clemons, our safety agent, will consistently inspect and secure all exits to prevent unauthorized access.
\item \textbf{\textbf{Student Safety Education}}: During the SEL (Social-Emotional Learning) block, teachers will provide students with education on safety procedures and guidance on whom to contact if they feel lost or unsafe. This will occur once a month.
\end{itemize}

Your cooperation and strict adherence to this protocol and the preventive measures outlined are crucial to ensuring the safety and security of our students. By working together and maintaining vigilance, we can significantly contribute to the overall safety of our school environment. Thank you for your attention and commitment to our students' safety.
