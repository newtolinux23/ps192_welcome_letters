\subsection*{Bell Schedule}
\label{sec:org10b6dee}
Dear Parent or Guardian,

A bell schedule specifies the start time and duration of one or more instructional periods on each day of a day pattern. A consistent daily schedule and step-by-step routines give children a predictable day. A Bell Schedule helps children:
\begin{itemize}
\item Feel in control of their environment
\item Feel safe, secure, and comfortable
\item Know what is happening now and what comes next
\item Know how to do an activity or task
\item Engage in learning
\end{itemize}

Just like adults, children feel more confident and secure when their daily activities are predictable and familiar.

\subsection*{Uniform Policy}
\label{sec:org46707dd}
\textbf{\textbf{Uniform Details}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Burgundy Shirt}: All students are required to wear a burgundy-colored shirt as the upper part of their uniform.
\item \textbf{Navy Pants}: Navy blue pants or trousers are to be worn as the lower part of the uniform.
\end{enumerate}

The uniform policy will be enforced during school hours and at all school-related events and activities, such as field trips and special assemblies.

\textbf{\textbf{Benefits of the Uniform Policy}}

Uniforms serve as a unifying element within our school community and offer several significant advantages:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Promoting Equality}: Uniforms eliminate socioeconomic disparities among students, ensuring that everyone is dressed the same way, regardless of their family’s financial circumstances.
\item \textbf{Enhancing Focus}: Wearing uniforms reduces distractions related to fashion and peer pressure, allowing students to concentrate on their studies and personal growth.
\item \textbf{Fostering School Pride}: A uniform instills a sense of pride and belonging among students, helping them identify with and appreciate their school community.
\item \textbf{Improving Safety}: Uniforms make it easier to identify intruders on school premises, enhancing overall security.
\item \textbf{Preparing for Future Success}: Encouraging a dress code similar to professional attire helps prepare students for future careers where a professional appearance is important.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{\textbf{Dress Down Days}}

We understand that personal expression is important, and therefore, "Dress Down Days" will be occasionally scheduled throughout the school year, allowing students to express their individuality through clothing choices. We kindly request your cooperation and support in ensuring that your child arrives at school dressed in accordance with our uniform policy. We believe that this will contribute to a more positive and productive learning environment for all students.
\pagebreak
\vspace*{-0.5cm}

\textbf{\textbf{Contact Information}}

Should you have any questions or concerns regarding the uniform policy, please feel free to reach out to our Parent Coordinator, Ms. Angela Rijo, via the following channels:

\textbf{\textbf{Closing}}

Thank you for your partnership in nurturing a strong and vibrant learning community at P.S. 192. We look forward to a successful and enriching academic year ahead.

\subsection*{Promotional Criteria and Grading Policy}
\label{sec:org5a5fc89}
Dear Parent or Guardian,

Chancellor Regulation A-501 implements a system-wide promotion policy with
clearly defined standards for promotion for each grade. The P.S. 192 Promotional Criteria Policy provides the process and procedures
for the implementation of this promotion policy. This policy is effective as of September 5th, 2024.

This policy is being promulgated in the context of the following goals established by the Chancellor’s
Regulation A-501:

All students in Kindergarten through grade 5 will meet or exceed rigorous academic standards in a performance-based core curriculum. In grades 3 through 5, all students will meet or exceed the promotion standards referred to in this regulation, and set forth in DOE issued guidance, in order to be promoted to the next grade and, ultimately, to be prepared for college and careers.

\begin{itemize}
\item The entire school community will be engaged continuously in creating and supporting effective strategies for improved student achievement.
\item A comprehensive student assessment system, aligned with established State and City performance standards, will be used on an ongoing basis to measure student progress and to improve classroom instruction.

\subsection*{Visitor and Safety Guidelines and Procedures}
\label{sec:org191bdbf}
Dear Parent or Guardian,

We are pleased to present the guidelines and procedures for our esteemed institution, Jacob H. Schiff/P.S. 192. These guidelines and procedures have been meticulously designed to prioritize the safety and security of all individuals—our valued students, dedicated staff, and respected visitors—while fostering an environment that is welcoming and inclusive. We sincerely appreciate your cooperation in adhering to these essential protocols.
\begin{greenbox}[Visitor Registration]
\begin{itemize}
\item Upon Arrival: All visitors, including parents, guardians, volunteers, contractors, and esteemed guests, are kindly requested to enter the school premises through the main entrance and proceed to the safety agent desk for registration.
\item Warm Welcome: Our School Safety Agent or designated school staff will warmly welcome all visitors, inquire about the purpose of your visit, and request a valid photo ID.
\item Identification: To ensure security, visitors must present a valid form of identification, such as a driver's license, government-issued ID, foreign or US passport, or consulate identification card. Subsequently, visitors will be given an identification sticker, which must be prominently displayed throughout their visit. The School Safety Agent will assist in issuing the identification sticker.
\item Assistance Notification: Once the School Safety Agent or designated school staff completes the registration process, they will notify the parent coordinator by calling X1190. This will facilitate further assistance for the visitor, whether waiting in the lobby or the auditorium.
\item Departure Protocol: Visitors are kindly requested to sign out with the School Safety Agent or designated school staff upon leaving the building. The identification sticker should be returned; the main entrance is the recommended exit point.
\end{itemize}
\end{greenbox}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Language Assistance:}
\begin{itemize}
\item When a visitor does not communicate in English, our School Safety Agent (SSA) or designated school staff member will try to identify the visitor's language. A multi-language poster displayed at the safety desk will be used for language identification. Once the language is ascertained, the visitor will be directed to the parent coordinator for further assistance. In cases where we need staff proficient in the visitor's language on-site, the parent coordinator will engage the DOE's Over-the-Phone Interpretation Unit to arrange an on-demand interpreter.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Scheduled Visits: We encourage non-emergency visits to be scheduled whenever possible to ensure that staff members are available to meet with visitors and minimize disruption to instructional time.

\item Visitor Arrival: Upon arriving for a scheduled appointment, visitors are kindly requested to follow the same entrance and registration process outlined above.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Media and Privacy: To uphold our students and staff members' privacy and confidentiality, visitors are kindly requested not to take photographs or record videos while on school premises.
\item Respect for Privacy: Any personal information or observations made during the visit should not be shared without appropriate consent or authorization from the NYC DOE.
\end{itemize}

Dear Parent or Guardian,

This letter is to notify you that, our school,Jacob H. Schiff | PS 192, has been
designated for Local Support and Improvement (LSI) by the New York State
Education Department (NYSED) for the 2023-24 school year based on the performance of our students on New York State assessments in school year 2022-23. The
designation “Local Support and Improvement (LSI),” recognizes that all schools,
even higher performing schools like ours, are in a continuous improvement mode

currently available. The school’s designation is part of the state’s
accountability system consistent with federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) requirements.

I’m confident that the programs and interventions that are being implemented
citywide and at our school will continue to make the 2023-24 school year a high-quality educational experience for your child.

Thank you for your ongoing partnership and support. Our entire school staff is
committed to ensuring a successful year for our students and school community.
