\textbf{PARENT NOTIFICATION LETTER FOR SCHOOLS DESIGNATED FOR LSI}

Dear Parent or Guardian,

This letter is to notify you that, our school,Jacob H. Schiff | PS 192, has been designated for Local Support and Improvement (LSI) by the New York State Education Department (NYSED) for the 2023-24 school year based on the performance of our students on New York State assessments in school year 2022-23. The designation “Local Support and Improvement (LSI),” recognizes that all schools, even higher performing schools like ours, are in a continuous improvement mode and can benefit from local support from their districts to meet students’ differentiated needs. LSI or ``Good Standing'' is the best accountability status currently available. The school’s designation is part of the state’s accountability system consistent with federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) requirements.

I’m confident that the programs and interventions that are being implemented citywide and at our school will continue to make the 2023-24 school year a high-quality educational experience for your child.

Thank you for your ongoing partnership and support. Our entire school staff is committed to ensuring a successful year for our students and school community. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at 212-775-9560.

Sincerely,
