In the "Values Sticker Swap" activity, elementary school students each receive a deck
of stickers or cards with messages related to core values like leadership, compassion,
honor, justice, and self-discipline. The goal is for students to interact with their
peers and other students throughout the school to exchange stickers. By the end of the
activity, every student will have a deck of stickers, each with different messages,
promoting a deeper understanding of these important values and encouraging meaningful
discussions with their classmates.
