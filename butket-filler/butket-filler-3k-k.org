** Chapter 1: The Magical School Bell
Leo the Lion and Lea the Lioness were excited for their first day at PS192. They had heard that it was a very special school, filled with joy and magic. As they walked through the big doors, they heard a bell ring. But this was no ordinary bell—this was the magical school bell! It shimmered with colors and sparkled like the stars.

Ms. Joy, their teacher, welcomed them with a big smile. "Leo and Lea," she said, "here at PS192, we believe in filling each other's buckets with kindness and respect. Today, you'll start learning how to do just that!"

** Chapter 2: The Hallway of Justice
Ms. Joy led the class down the hallway, which was called the Hallway of Justice. The walls were lined with pictures of students standing up for what is right. There was a golden scale that tipped toward fairness, and whenever someone made a just decision, the scale would glow.

"Justice means treating everyone fairly and standing up for what is right," Ms. Joy explained. Leo and Lea noticed a friend being left out of a game and remembered what Ms. Joy said. They invited the friend to join, and the scale glowed brightly. Leo and Lea felt their buckets fill with happiness.

** Chapter 3: The Garden of Honor
Next, Ms. Joy took them to the Garden of Honor. The flowers here only bloomed when someone did something honorable. Honor means being truthful, keeping promises, and showing respect.

Leo and Lea saw a flower wilting. "Why is it sad?" Leo asked. Ms. Joy explained that someone had forgotten to return a borrowed book. Lea quickly remembered that she had borrowed a crayon and hadn’t returned it. She ran back to give it to its owner, and the flower bloomed beautifully. Their buckets felt fuller than ever!

** Chapter 4: The Tower of Self-Discipline
Finally, Ms. Joy brought them to the Tower of Self-Discipline. It was tall and strong, built brick by brick by students who practiced self-control and patience. The tower’s bricks were inscribed with words like "Patience," "Focus," and "Determination."

Leo was tempted to run ahead and play, but he remembered the lesson about self-discipline. He took a deep breath, waited his turn, and focused on the task. Another brick appeared on the tower with his name on it, and his bucket filled with pride.

** Chapter 5: The Bucket Filler's Secret
At the end of the day, Ms. Joy gathered everyone. "You’ve all done something amazing today," she said. "By practicing justice, honor, and self-discipline, you’ve filled your buckets and others’. That’s the secret of being a bucket filler—when you help others feel good, you feel good too!"

Leo and Lea looked at their buckets, now overflowing with happiness. They knew that every day at PS192 would be an opportunity to fill more buckets, make new friends, and grow together.
