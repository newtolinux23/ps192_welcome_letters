\textbf{Principal's Message April 2024}

Dear Parents and Guardians,
 
We are pleased to welcome you to an engaging and dynamic month at PS 192, The School of Joyful Learning. This year has already been filled with remarkable achievements, and we eagerly anticipate the many exciting events yet to unfold.
 
Currently, we are diligently preparing our students for the upcoming English Language Arts (ELA) tests, scheduled from April 11th to April 18th. Additionally, we are thrilled to begin planning for the graduation ceremonies of our 3K, Pre-K, Kindergarten, and Fifth Grade students.
 
This month’s calendar is brimming with opportunities for parent engagement and student activities. Please note the following important dates:

\begin{itemize}
\item Parent Association Meeting: Tuesday, April 9, at 8:00 AM
\item Coffee with the Principal: Thursday, April 18, at 8:00 AM in the Library
\item School Leadership Team (SLT) Meeting: Friday, April 19, at 2:30 PM
\end{itemize}

Your participation in these events is invaluable and greatly enhances our school community.

We also remind you that every Tuesday is Terrific Tuesday, held virtually from 2:20 PM to 3:35 PM. This session provides a wonderful opportunity to discuss your child’s progress directly with their teachers.
 
On behalf of the staff at PS 192, we wish you a delightful and restorative Spring Recess.
 
Warm regards,
