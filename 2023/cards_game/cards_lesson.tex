	In the "Values Sticker Swap" activity, elementary school students each receive a deck
	of stickers or cards with messages related to core values like leadership, compassion,
	honor, justice, and self-discipline. The goal is for students to interact with their
	peers and other students throughout the school to exchange stickers. By the end of the
	activity, every student will have a deck of stickers, each with different messages,
	promoting a deeper understanding of these important values and encouraging meaningful
	discussions with their classmates.
