PS 192 follows a comprehensive curriculum that integrates literacy, math, social studies, and science. We also focus on social-emotional learning, emphasizing respect, responsibility, and empathy.

** Looping
At PS 192, we use the looping model where students stay with the same teacher for two years, ensuring continuity and deep relationships between teachers and students.

We regularly assess student progress through a combination of formative and summative assessments. Report cards are distributed three times a year, and student-led conferences are held to discuss goals and progress.

** Medication
If your child requires medication during school hours, please submit the appropriate 504 medical form to the nurse’s office.

** Illness
Children should stay home if they are feeling unwell. Please notify the school if your child contracts a communicable disease, so we can inform other families.
