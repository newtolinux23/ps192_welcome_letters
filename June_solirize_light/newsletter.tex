\section{Principal Message}
\label{sec:orgc464f31}

\textbf{Subject: Welcome to June, 2024 at PS 192: The School of Joyful Learning!}

Greetings Parents and Guardians,

As we approach the end of this school year, I am filled with immense pride for the achievements we have made together at P.S. 192 and am equally excited about the plans we have for the upcoming school year.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all parents who have contributed to our school events throughout the year. Your dedication in organizing and participating in our activities and your steadfast attendance at our parent workshops have been invaluable. Your unwavering support has made a significant impact on our school community.

Please note that Wednesday, June 26, 2024, will be our Graduation Day and the final day of school. On this day, your children will receive their report cards.

In closing, I would like to wish our fifth-grade students the very best as they transition to Middle School. I will miss each of you and your families and hope you carry with you cherished memories of your time at P.S. 192.

I wish everyone a delightful and restful summer and look forward to collaborating with many of you in the upcoming year.

Warm regards,

\section{Reminder}
\label{sec:orgeed60c0}
\begin{enumerate}
\item School Uniform Reminder: Please ensure your child comes to school dressed in their uniform daily, as it is an important part of our school's tradition and identity.
\item ID. To ensure the safety of children, and as per DOE regulation, you always need to bring your photo I.D when you come to your child’s school.
\item We highly recommend taking the time each week to touch base with your child's teachers. Whether through email, in-person meetings, ClassDojo, or virtual conferences, staying connected can greatly enhance your child's educational experience.
\item Library Mornings Program- We would like to inform all Parents and Guardians that the library is open for your use with your children from Monday to Friday, 7:00 to 7:50 am. This is a wonderful opportunity for you to borrow books, work on computers, and practice reading.
\item Lost Items - Please note that if your child misplaces any belongings, you are encouraged to visit the lost and found area. Items that remain unclaimed by the end of each month will be thoughtfully donated to the Salvation Army.
\end{enumerate}
